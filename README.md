## Introduction 
This music app is a prototype of what is essentially a music/musician based social media app. Within it, you would have an account that is also linked to your Spotify account. What this mean is your profile would be populated with your info (Name/Username, a self-created bio about yourself, etc...), and it will use your Spotify account to display things like your top 5 favorite artists and music by them. This would all be displayed through their profile through multiple pages that would accurately represent what music this user loves and the ability to share that with others through their profile (via some sort of share link(s).
